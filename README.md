The project
----
Jean-Eude grows grains: oat, wheat, corn, barley and soy. He uses four different types of fertilizers (F1, F2, F3 and F4), in the following quantities (per ton of fertilizer in order to produce one unit of grains):

Keeping in mind that he has limited yearly quantities of each type of fertilizer, he would like to optimize his output according to the grains’ prices. You’re going to develop a program that will take his fertilizer resources and the prices of each type of grain as parameter. It will display the quantities to produce, as well as the total value of his output.
