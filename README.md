The project
----
As you know, when compiling a program, only the files that are dependent on recently modified sources are effectively recompiled during a [**Make function call**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Functions.html). In order to do this, this binary parses the **Makefile** in the current folder so that a dependency graph can be generated.Next, it analyzes this graph in order to execute the **minimum amount of compilations**.


In this project you must simulate the behavior of Make by reconstructing the dependency graph, and then **display all of the commands to be executed** after a source file is modified.First, youâ€™ll need to display the adjacency matrix and the dependency strings.
